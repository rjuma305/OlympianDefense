🎮 Integration Notes for R
These structures are fully extensible and can be imported anywhere you calculate:

Ability activation

Tower placement

Upgrade clicks

Easily tie them to the playerResources state and update UI accordingly

We can later add Relic Shard costs for elite upgrades or divine unlocks
